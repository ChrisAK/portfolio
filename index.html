                  <li>I REALLY love to code!</li>
                  <li>I’ve spent years doing things I’ve enjoyed; I’ve been a teacher, a “full-time” musician, and even built machines for a factory and I loved all of it. But it wasn’t until I learned what my friend was passionate about that I found out what I wanted to do for the future. After spending far too long looking over his shoulder at indecipherable lines of letter, numbers, and symbols he finally introduced me to coding. As soon as I started I knew I was hooked. Programming tapped into both the creative and analytical parts of my mind in a way nothing had before. From there I pushed to learn more. I started at freeCodeCamp and eventually enrolled in General Assembly’s	Web Development Immersive program. I am hoping to move on to a company steeped in new and interesting technology so I never have to stop learning about and engaging in a field I feel truly passionate about.</li>

                <h4>Tic-Tac-Toe</h4>
                  <p>This Tic-Tac-Toe game showcases the skills I have gained through the first few weeks of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.</p>
                  <p>By building a custom game engine and front end I have made a game that allows people to play 1 vs 1 local tic-tac-toe as well as login so they can keep track of their games.</p>

                <h3>Project 2:</h3>
                <h4>Full-Stack: DM Tool</h4>
                <p>This DM Tool game showcases the full stack development skills I have gained through the first half of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. This program is intended to help Dungeon Masters not only keep track of when each of their campaigns is scheduled to play, but also keep a log of encounters to be used in each campaign.</p>
